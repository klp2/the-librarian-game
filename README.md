## 🎭 Game Lore

You are a scholar who has discovered the entrance to an ancient, mystical library buried deep beneath the earth. This is no ordinary library—its halls shift and change, its books contain living stories, and knowledge itself has become a form of power.

Each piece of equipment you find tells a story, and through use, these stories grow and evolve. The more you understand about your tools and the world around you, the more powerful you become. But beware—this library guards its secrets jealously, and other seekers have fallen to its challenges.

Your goal is to explore ever-deeper into the library's depths, collecting knowledge and growing in power, until you can reach the heart of this mystical place and uncover its greatest secrets.
