# Release v0.5.1 - The Librarian

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Fixed Win Condition Requirements (Issue #26)
- **FIXED**: Win condition now correctly requires reaching **level 10 AND defeating all monsters** (previously only required defeating monsters)
- Players can no longer achieve victory by clearing all monsters before reaching level 10
- Uses a one-way flag system to remember when level 10 is reached, ensuring the requirement persists throughout the game
- Comprehensive test coverage ensures the fix works correctly across all scenarios
- Status messages clearly communicate both requirements to players

This addresses the major gameplay issue where skilled players could win too early by efficiently clearing monsters without sufficient character progression.

## üîß Under the Hood Improvements

### Tileset System Foundation
- **ADDED**: Secure infrastructure for future tileset support (not yet user-visible)
- Implemented comprehensive security validation pipeline with path traversal protection
- Added memory-safe asset loading with resource limits (10MB files, 50MB cache)
- Built foundation for community tileset support with sandboxed file operations
- 100% test coverage for security-critical components

This foundational work prepares for upcoming graphical enhancements while maintaining the game's security and stability.
